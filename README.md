Digital elevation model (DEM) is known as one of the most significant fundamental geographical data, 
the theory, method and application of which are hot research issues in geography, especially in 
geomorphology, hydrology, soil and other fields. Thanks for the technical support from the Book
“Getting Started and Best Practices with Tensor-flow for Deep Learning”.
 
The CODE introduces a new term “DEM super-resolution”, which reconstructs high-resolution DEM form low-resolution DEM.
